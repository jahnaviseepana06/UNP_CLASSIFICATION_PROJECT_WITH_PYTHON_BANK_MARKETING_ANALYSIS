# UNP_CLASSIFICATION_PROJECT_WITH_PYTHON_BANK_MARKETING_ANALYSIS

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using the Bank Marketing Dataset. The dataset contains demographic, financial, and campaign-related information about bank customers. The main objective of the project is to build and evaluate classification models that can help banks identify potential customers likely to respond positively to marketing campaigns. The process involved several steps, starting with data collection and preprocessing, where missing values were handled, categorical variables were encoded, and numerical features were scaled. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was then performed to visualize important patterns, relationships, and class distributions within the data. Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest were implemented and compared. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to determine the most effective approach. The project was executed using Python in Google Colab, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. A presentation summarizing the findings was also created in PowerPoint. The repository includes links to both the Colab Notebook and the PPT Presentation, providing a complete overview of the project workflow and results.
